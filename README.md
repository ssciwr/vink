# OpenAI Whisper standalone distribution

**This is still under construction**

This is a stand-alone application that packages [OpenAI's Whisper](https://github.com/openai/whisper) into one
executable file. Additionally, it provides a minimalistic graphical user interface for transcription.

## Installation

Please choose and download the standalone application for your operating system from the Releases section.

## Usage

Running the `whisper` standalone executable without any arguments will fire up the graphical user interface.

If you want to work with `whisper`'s command line interface instead, you can do so by providing arguments:

```
whisper --help
```
